                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 1, 2025</p>
                <p><strong>Please have a look at our</strong> Privacy Policy</p>

                <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
                <p>At Everything Converter 169, we are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparent data practices. This comprehensive Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share your information when you use our free online unit conversion platform. We believe that privacy is a fundamental right, and we have designed our services with privacy-by-design principles to ensure your personal information remains secure and protected.</p>

                <p>Everything Converter 169 provides over 3,000 unit converters across 21 categories, serving students, professionals, engineers, scientists, and everyday users worldwide. Our mission is to provide accurate, fast, and reliable unit conversions while maintaining the highest standards of data protection and user privacy. We understand that trust is earned through transparency and consistent action, which is why we have created this detailed policy to help you understand exactly how your information is handled.</p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide and improve our services. The information we collect falls into several categories:</p>

                <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
                <p>When you visit Everything Converter 169, we automatically collect certain technical information to ensure our service functions properly and to improve user experience. This includes your IP address (which is anonymized within 24 hours), browser type and version, operating system, device type, screen resolution, and general location information (country/region level only). We also collect usage data such as pages visited, time spent on our site, conversion tools used, and referral sources.</p>

                <p>This technical information helps us understand how our platform is being used, identify potential issues, optimize performance, and make data-driven improvements. For example, if we notice that mobile users are having difficulty with certain converters, we can prioritize mobile optimization. All automatically collected data is aggregated and anonymized to protect individual privacy.</p>

                <h3>Voluntarily Provided Information</h3>
                <p>We only collect personal information that you voluntarily provide through direct interaction with our platform. This may include feedback submitted through contact forms, email correspondence, user preferences you choose to save, and any information you provide when reporting bugs or suggesting improvements. We never require registration or personal information to use our core conversion tools.</p>

                <p>When you choose to provide feedback or contact us, we use this information solely to respond to your inquiry and improve our services. We maintain records of correspondence to ensure consistent and helpful support. Any personal information you share is handled with the utmost care and is never shared with third parties without your explicit consent.</p>

                <h3>Conversion Data</h3>
                <p>The values you enter into our converters are processed locally in your browser whenever possible and are not transmitted to our servers unless necessary for specific advanced calculations. When data is transmitted, it is immediately processed and discarded without storage. We do not maintain logs of your conversion activities, and we cannot see what specific values you are converting.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use collected information exclusively for legitimate purposes that benefit our users and improve our services. Our primary uses include providing accurate unit conversion services, maintaining and improving platform functionality, analyzing usage patterns to optimize user experience, responding to user inquiries and feedback, ensuring security and preventing abuse, and complying with legal obligations.</p>

                <p>We employ privacy-by-design principles, meaning we minimize data collection, anonymize information wherever possible, and regularly review our data practices to ensure they remain aligned with our privacy commitments. We never use your information for marketing purposes, sell your data to third parties, or create detailed user profiles for advertising.</p>

                <h3>Service Provision and Improvement</h3>
                <p>Your information helps us deliver reliable, fast, and accurate conversion services. We analyze usage patterns to identify which converters are most popular, which areas need improvement, and how we can enhance the overall user experience. This analysis is conducted on aggregated, anonymized data that cannot be traced back to individual users.</p>

                <p>We use technical information to optimize our platform's performance across different devices and browsers, ensuring consistent functionality for all users. This includes monitoring loading times, identifying compatibility issues, and optimizing our code for better performance.</p>

                <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. This excludes trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

                <p>In the event of a business transfer, merger, or acquisition, user information may be transferred as part of the business assets. However, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>We may use trusted third-party services to help us operate our platform, such as content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure fast loading times worldwide, analytics services to understand user behavior (with anonymized data), security services to protect against abuse and attacks, and hosting services to maintain our platform's availability.</p>

                <p>All third-party services we use are carefully vetted for their privacy practices and are required to maintain the same level of data protection that we provide. We have data processing agreements with all third-party providers that handle any user data.</p>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We implement comprehensive security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Our security framework includes encrypted data transmission using industry-standard SSL/TLS protocols, secure server infrastructure with regular security updates, access controls limiting who can access user data, regular security audits and vulnerability assessments, and incident response procedures for potential security breaches.</p>

                <p>We employ both automated and manual security monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized access attempts. Our servers are located in secure data centers with physical security measures, and we maintain backup systems to ensure data availability while protecting against data loss.</p>

                <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We regularly review and update our security practices to address emerging threats and maintain the highest levels of protection.</p>

                <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
                <p>You have several rights regarding your personal information and how it is handled. These rights include the right to access information we have about you, the right to correct any inaccurate information, the right to delete your personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to restrict processing of your information, the right to data portability, and the right to object to certain processing activities.</p>

                <p>You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the information provided in this policy. We will respond to your requests within 30 days and will verify your identity before processing requests that involve access to personal information.</p>

                <h3>Cookie and Tracking Controls</h3>
                <p>You can control cookie settings through your browser preferences. Most browsers allow you to refuse cookies, delete existing cookies, and receive notifications when cookies are being set. However, disabling cookies may affect the functionality of our platform.</p>

                <p>We provide clear information about all cookies we use and obtain consent where required by law. You can withdraw consent at any time through your browser settings or by contacting us directly.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Everything Converter 169 is designed to be educational and useful for users of all ages, including students. However, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take immediate steps to delete that information.</p>

                <p>Parents and guardians are encouraged to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal information without permission.</p>

                <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Everything Converter 169 is accessible worldwide, and we may transfer your information to servers located in different countries to provide our services effectively. We ensure that international transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and implement appropriate safeguards to protect your information.</p>

                <p>When transferring data internationally, we use standard contractual clauses, adequacy decisions, or other approved transfer mechanisms to ensure your data remains protected according to high privacy standards.</p>

                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and provide notice of significant changes through our website or other appropriate means.</p>

                <p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Continued use of our services after policy updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
