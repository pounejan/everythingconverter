                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, tablet, or mobile phone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently and to provide information to website owners. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your device's hard drive and stored there.</p>

                <p>Cookies do not contain any personal information that can identify you individually, but personal information we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.</p>

                <h3>Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                <p>We use several types of cookies to provide and improve our services:</p>

                <p><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are necessary for our website to function properly and cannot be switched off. They are usually set in response to actions you take, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>

                <p><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information about how you use our website, such as which pages you visit most often and if you receive error messages. This information is used to improve how our website works and to identify and fix technical issues.</p>

                <p><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your preferred units or language) and provide enhanced, more personalized features. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>Everything Converter 169 uses cookies for several important purposes that enhance your experience and help us provide better services:</p>

                <h3>Service Functionality</h3>

This includes remembering your preferred units, maintaining your place in multi-step conversions, and ensuring consistent functionality during your session. These cookies help us provide a smooth, uninterrupted experience while using our converters.</p>

                <p>Functionality cookies also remember your preferences for display settings, such as theme choices or layout preferences, so you don't have to reconfigure these settings each time you visit our platform. This personalization makes our tools more convenient and user-friendly.</p>

                <h3>Performance and Analytics</h3>
                <p>We use performance cookies to understand how visitors interact with our website, which helps us improve our services. These cookies collect information about which converters are most popular, how long users spend on different pages, and which features are most valuable to our users.</p>

                <p>This information is collected in aggregate form and cannot be used to identify individual users. We use this data to optimize our platform's performance, identify and fix technical issues, and make data-driven decisions about new features and improvements.</p>

                <h3>Security and Fraud Prevention</h3>
                <p>We use cookies to help protect our platform and users from security threats and fraudulent activities. These cookies help us identify suspicious behavior, prevent automated attacks, and ensure that our services are used appropriately. Security cookies are essential for maintaining the integrity and safety of our platform.</p>

                <h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>
                <p>We may work with trusted third-party services that set cookies on our behalf to help us provide better services. These third parties are carefully selected and must comply with strict privacy and security standards. We have agreements with all third-party providers to ensure they handle data responsibly and in accordance with our privacy standards.</p>

                <h3>Analytics Services</h3>
                <p>We may use third-party analytics services to help us understand how our website is used and to improve our services. These services use cookies to collect information about your use of our website, which is then used to compile reports and help us improve our website. The information collected includes the number of visitors, where visitors come from, and which pages they visit.</p>

                <p>All analytics data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be used to identify individual users. We use this information solely to improve our services and better understand our users' needs and preferences.</p>

                <h3>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</h3>
                <p>We use CDNs to ensure our website loads quickly for users around the world. CDNs may set cookies to optimize content delivery and improve loading times. These cookies help us provide a faster, more reliable experience for users regardless of their geographic location.</p>

                <h3>Opt-Out Options</h3>
                <p>For cookies set by third-party services, you can often opt out directly through the third-party provider's website. Many analytics and advertising companies also provide opt-out mechanisms for their services. We provide information about these options where applicable.</p>

                <p>You can also use tools like the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out tool or the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out tool to manage advertising cookies from multiple companies at once.</p>
